# No-skipping Lists
Create Spotify playlists using your top songs for any period of time in Last.fm

After some weeks using [Lasf.fm](http://last.fm/), I started a pattern: Add to favorites
the top 5 songs that I listened to in the last 7 days.

Then, I created a playlist using those favorite songs, and listening to it, I realised how
infrequent it was to me to skip a song. So I decided to write this, to make other people
able to create a playlist using the same method.
